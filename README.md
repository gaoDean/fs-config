# ferris sweep config
This is a 34 key zmk config designed for 34 keyboards, such as my Ferris sweep.

This config features three layers; Base, Num and Func, as well as a combo layer that is used to access symbols. 
The Combo layer is based on Kombol's combo layer, with a few alterations that remove 4-key combos and use of qmk.
